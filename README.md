# My Reasons for Making This Project and Using Defold + Lua

I had created this project when I began started playing around with the Defold game engine to make web games with the Lua
programming language. It was intened to be a stepping stone for a larger project that I have been planning, centered around
learning the Korean language, gamification and the web. Defold allows me to easily work with the web, use it with my tech stack 
and I was already fimiliar with the Lua programing language as it is a very common for games and it was actually the first
programming language that I learned, so this is why I have chosen to use Defold in this case.
